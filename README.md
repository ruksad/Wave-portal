# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

1. File scripts/run.js is run by hardhat to create temporary etherium blockchain network on your local and deploys it.
2. ``npx hardhat run scripts/run.js``
